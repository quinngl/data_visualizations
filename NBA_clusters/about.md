This code comes from an undergraduate class I took on Machine Learning, with the topic of the assignment being K Means Clustering. While the clustering code was the priority of the lesson, my favorite part of this assignment was generating visuals to explain my choices of NBA players. This was one of, if not my favorite assignment completed in my undergraduate classes in data science because of the importance of the visualizations to the message of the work and the creative freedom allowed on this assignment!
